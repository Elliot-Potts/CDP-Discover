# CDP-Discover

A Python application to listen for CDP packets and parse them into a Flet UI.


## Requirements

- **Scapy** (For interaction with network packets, https://pypi.org/project/scapy/)
- **Psutil** (For network interface selection, https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
- **Flet** (For the GUI, https://pypi.org/project/flet/)


## TODO

- CDP info container to be updated (keys bolded; container widened/separated?)
- Address header width issue
